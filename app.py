                     ### **AI-Powered Early Disease Detection System**  

This is an AI model capable of analyzing medical images (X-rays, MRIs, etc.) to detect early-stage diseases such as cancer, tuberculosis, and fractures with high accuracy.
                      This technology aims to assist doctors by providing rapid and reliable diagnostics, reducing their workload and enabling faster treatment decisions.
                     By leveraging AI for early detection, the system can significantly improve patient outcomes while ensuring accessibility for underprivileged
                     communities through compatibility with low-cost hardware. Additionally, this solution promotes sustainability by minimizing
                     the need for excessive medical tests, optimizing resource utilization, and enhancing healthcare efficiency.
