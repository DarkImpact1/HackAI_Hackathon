    ### **AI-Powered Early Disease Detection System**  

    Medi Assist is an AI-driven diagnostic assistant designed to analyze medical images (X-rays, MRIs, etc.) and detect early-stage diseases such as cancer, tuberculosis, and fractures with high accuracy.  

    This project serves as a **virtual assistant for doctors**, helping them **save time** by providing rapid and reliable diagnostic insights. By automating the initial analysis of medical images, it reduces the workload of healthcare professionals, allowing them to focus on **treating more patients** efficiently.  

    ### **Key Benefits:**  
    ‚úÖ **Early Detection:** AI-powered analysis enables the identification of diseases at an early stage, leading to timely medical intervention.  
    ‚úÖ **Time-Saving for Doctors:** Automates image analysis, reducing manual workload and speeding up decision-making.  
    ‚úÖ **Accessible Healthcare:** Designed to work on low-cost hardware, ensuring medical assistance reaches underprivileged communities.  
    ‚úÖ **Sustainability:** Optimizes medical resources by minimizing unnecessary tests, improving healthcare efficiency.  

    By leveraging AI for early disease detection, this system enhances patient outcomes, supports doctors in managing more cases, and contributes to a **scalable and efficient healthcare ecosystem**.

             1. Select the disease you want to detect from the dropdown menu.
             2. Choose to upload an image or capture one using your camera.
